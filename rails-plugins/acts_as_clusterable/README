This plugin makes it very easy to cluster active record objects. It
uses the clusterer Ruby gem. 

Download and install the gem, and its dependencies. Copy the plugin
into vendor/plugins from the following svn repository 

http://opensvn.csie.org/acts_as_clusterable/

Add the following lines to your model:

  acts_as_clusterable :fields  => ['title','text']

if no fields are given then it will use all text and string fields present in the model.
Now, doing clustering is as easy as:

Joke.hierarchical_clustering()
Joke.kmeans_clustering()

By default the number of clusters is <i>Math.sqrt(no. of objects)</i>,
so to get custom no. of clusters give, the no. of clusters as an
argument, i.e., 

Joke.hierarchical_clustering(2)
Joke.kmeans_clustering(2)
